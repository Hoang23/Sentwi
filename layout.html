    <h3>About</h3>
    Looking to get informed on the sentiment of a particular topic? <br>
    Sentwi filters tweets by hashtags to computationally discover the trending sentiment of a topic using Natural Language Processing. <br>
    It uses NLTK's VADER, a lexicon rule-based approach that takes in consideration both polarity/sentiment through positive and negative words and its strength. 
    <br>
    Sentwi currently looks at the daily fluctuations from hashtags going back a week. <br>
